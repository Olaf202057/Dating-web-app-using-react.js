### Project details
Conversion of static HTML UI to React components


## Usage

```
npm install
npm start

> open http://localhost:3333
```

Next you will see:

```

content is served from /path/to/project/folder

## Extras:

I went ahead and set this project up with Redux. I have not fully implemented this, but the basic framework is here.  The additional directories to be used with Redux are as follows:
```
-actions
-config
  -store.js
-reducers
-constants
```
